Math is cool.

See master header int/anmat.h for all public includes.

Each public module has:
  - a source file found in src/<module>.c
  - an API header file found in inc/<module>.h
  - a unit test found in tst/<module>-test.c

Each public API is:
  - prepended with "anmat"
  - marked with the name of the module (i.e., Matrix)
